## Aim:
Map Illumina ChIP-seq data on the human genome, build hg19.

## Requirements:
Work from a directory that contains the file hg19.chrom.sizes and the script bedGraphToBigWig.
Two directories above the working directory there should be a directory called bowtie, containing the indexed h919 genome, or change path in script to this directory (../../bowtie/).


## Notes:
